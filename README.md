# Vitamins

This is the folder that I keep everything for all my projects inâ€¦

There are details about this folder and such on my blog @ <http://skippy.org.uk/guides/arduino/my-library-folder>

At some point I will work out how to do sub modules or something to referance things which are stored in git elsewhere
